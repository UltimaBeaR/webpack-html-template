Basic webpack setup for HTML/CSS development. Supports scss and live reloading

USAGE
    Run ```npm install```
    Then run ```npm start``` every time live reloading should start (opens at http://localhost:5500/)

Inside scss absolute urls (example - url('/img/test.png')) would resolve to public directory (example - projectRoot/public/img/test.png)
